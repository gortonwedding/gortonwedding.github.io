            <!-- About Us -->
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Alicia & Acton</h1>
            <p>Acton and Alicia are currently students at the University of Illinois. Alicia is a licenced nurse, and is
                working on her BA. Acton is a PhD canadidate, hoping to finish his work in the next coming year.</p>

            <!-- How we Met -->
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">How we Met</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Acton likes to emphasize, we went on Craigslist</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Technically, that's true... but it wasn't as scandalous as that sounds.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">It was the ROOMMATE section on CraigsList...</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">We just lucked out.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Sometime in February of 2010, Acton was searching for a new roommate while Alicia was moving home from
                Aurora.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">We were both still playing the dating scene, but as time passed on, our friendship grew as we found
                ourselves enjoying each other's company more and more.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Against our better judgement, we took a chance.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">We fell in love.</p>

            <!-- The Proposal -->
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Proposal</h2>
            <p>Our fifth anniversary was coming up on New Years Eve, we wanted to do something special. After searching
                a few locations, we decided on Chicago, and found an event called Chi-town Rising. At first we were
                apprehensive but quickly found out Acton’s friend Boyang was playing at the event, we decided to go.</p>
            <p>The evening was brisk but beautiful. We spent the evening together, celebrating us. At midnight,
                fireworks began to go off all around us. We decided to get closer to the Chicago river, and under the
                night sky, with snow falling, and fireworks going off, Acton proposed. He of course put his spin on it,
                using augmented reality, over-laid “Will you Marry me” on a picture.</p>

            <h3>Dear Family and Friends,</h3>
            <p>We are very excited to be celebrating our wedding in the Dominican Republic. It has always been our dream to have a beach wedding, in a warm tropical place, surrounded by our family and friends. We have chosen the Dominican Republic based on recommendations by family and of a lot of thorough research. It is very important for us that everyone feels invited and can do so within their means. We realize how much is being asked to travel so far, and we hope the plan we’ve put together helps.<br><br>
                Punta Cana was chosen because it struck the right balance between natural beauty, ease of travel, and affordability. The location we’ve decided on promises endless activities and near enough features to allow plenty of exploration for anyone that wants to see the island beyond the resort.<br><br>
                Dreams Palms Beach Resort and Spa, is a four star “all-inclusive” hotel recommended by friends and family members that have previously stayed here, our wedding planner, and a number of review websites. Given the myriad of considerations to take into account for the wedding and the expenses involved in traveling, we believe the hotel offers the best value for everyone.<br><br>
                Many of the hotels and resorts in the area requires our wedding party to book a minimum of a seven night stay with a wedding, and the Dreams Palm Beach Resort requires a three day minimum, which we believe is much more reasonable. You can choose to stay longer, of course, because we’re trying to give you every excuse imaginable to leave a frigid winter to enjoy walking along white sandy beaches and warming your feet in a turquoise colored sea.</p>
                <h3>Are you hooked yet?</h3>
                <p>Good, because we are planning on being there from January 3rd to the 9th, 2017.<br><br>
                To help make your decision and planning easier, we are working to ensure that all you have to do is show up. The meals and many of the activities are all included with the room. The resort houses five restaurants, each with a different flavor and friendly to dietary requests.<br><br>
                We have secured discounts for travel and hotel bookings through a dedicated travel agent we’ve hired to help everyone find the best accommodations whether you choose to stay at the hotel or not, or need to arrange for different travel options. Of course you are always more than welcome to make your own arrangements, but the travel agent is already paid for and is expecting your call<br><br>
                Many of our friends and family prefer to seek their own adventures, and that may mean wanting to explore the island or stay at different digs. There are many wonderful places throughout Punta Cana and the Dominican Republic at large. But if you choose to stay outside of the hotel, a day pass will need to be purchased for each person. There are different day passes which include different things like food and activities; more about that towards the bottom.<br><br>
                Above all else, we want you with us, so don’t worry about spending anything extra on wedding gifts and treat this like a vacation. We’ll have meeting times setup for everyone to come together, but don’t feel required to attend any of them. We’ve tried to also include enough familiar faces in the invitation list so that everyone has a friend or family to be with and won’t feel like they’re being ignored or forced to fit in with a bunch of strangers.<br><br>
                We have hired LUXE to coordinate our wedding planning and they will be responsible for all hotel room bookings and air-fare. We have already reserved a block of rooms at the resort but we’re worried that once they are filled it will be difficult to make reservations at the hotel. We have arranged for as much privacy and exclusivity as we can for the wedding, but this is a popular destination and it will be a popular time of year for traveling to the tropics. Every room at the resort will be booked by someone, so we are working quickly and diligently through the planning to ensure everyone is given a head start to make their plans and reservations.<br><br>
                We are planning for the ceremony to begin at 5pm on January 7th, 2017.</p>

                <h3>Cost Estimates</h3>
                <p>These are the estimated costs, per person, for a three night stay. Keep in mind with the cost that it includes food, drinks, and activities at the resort.<br><br>
                Travel will cost extra and it is hard to estimate given the locations and distance everyone is flying from. We have already booked flight arrangements through our travel agent to scout the location in the spring, and the travel costs are very similar to estimates found on flights.google.com.</p>
